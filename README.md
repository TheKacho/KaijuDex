# KaijuDex
This is the KaijuDex created for the Code Louisville Capstone project for May 2022 Session.

# Goal
The goal of creating this program is to make a Pokedex-style of Kaiju/Giant Monster (like Godzilla or King Kong for example) entries and their movies.

# Tech
- **Backend** - C# 10 .NET 6
- **ORM** - EF 6
- **Database** - SQLite
- **Frontend**- Razor/ HTML/ JS/ CSS 

# Pattern
- MVC
- Code First DB Creation

# To Get Started
- Clone the repo
- Get to the Source folder/upload to Visual Studio Code
- Type "dotnet run" on the Terminal to run the program
- To navigate through the site, click either "Monster" or "Movie"
- From either "Monster" or "Movie" page, you can view, edit, or delete any available entry (Also, both "Monster" and "Movie" pages includes a "Add New Monster/Add New Movie" link)


- From the "Create Monster" page: add in monster's name (Minilla Godzilla), it's creator (Jun Fukuda),year created (1967), and its special attack (Atomic Smoke Rings). After that click "Submit" to add in a new Kaiju to the database!
